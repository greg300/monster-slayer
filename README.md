# monster-slayer
A Python 2 program written in Independent Study Computer Science class as a high school senior. The groundwork for a potential 2D RPG game, using the Kivy framework.

The current program features completely self-implemented movement and attack capabilities. The controls are:
- A, D to move left/right
- W to jump
- Space to attack

At some point, the plan is to create a full-fledged game with this groundwork.

Uses the Kivy framework for Python 2.
